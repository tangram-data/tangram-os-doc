# Onboarding Guide: Integrating a Native App with Tangram

Welcome! This guide will help you onboard your own **Native App** to Tangram‚Äîan app that exposes a REST API, such as a data warehouse service, ML platform, or analytics backend.

Tangram enables you to treat your app's resources (like databases, tables, models, etc.) as first-class citizens by mapping REST API operations into the Tangram resource/action model.  
This is achieved by specifying your API using OpenAPI, then mapping API operations to Tangram resources and actions in your manifest.

---

## üö¶ What is a Native App in Tangram?

A **Native App** is any app that exposes its capabilities via a REST API, documented (ideally) in OpenAPI format. Tangram integrates with your app by calling these HTTP endpoints, mapping the business logic to its own resource semantics.

**Examples:**  
- Data warehouse APIs (e.g., Iceberg catalog service)
- ML platforms (e.g., MLflow)
- Analytics/BI servers

## üõ†Ô∏è Steps to Integrate

1. **Document your API** using OpenAPI and save it as `open_api.yaml`.
2. **Define resource types and actions** in your manifest (see `resource_types.pkl` for examples).
3. **Map each operationId** to a resource/action in `spec.pkl`, using templates to extract names/IDs.
