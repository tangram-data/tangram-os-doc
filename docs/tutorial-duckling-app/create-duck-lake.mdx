# Create Duck Lake

## Creating a duck lake

To create a new duck lake:

1. In the Duckling App, navigate to the Duck Lakes tab.
2. Click the New DuckLake button:

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>
  <img src={CreateDuckLake} width={"100%"} />
</div>

### Configure Storage Bucket(Optional)

By default, DuckLake will use the default storage bucket managed by the Duckling App.

If you'd like to use a different storage bucket:
* You can specify a custom bucket during creation.
* Ensure that the Duckling App service account has the CreateFolder privilege on the selected bucket.


## Register duck lake to Tangram SQL catalog
To query a DuckLake using a Duckling instance, youâ€™ll need to register it with the Tangram SQL catalog:

1. Open the Tangram SQL Editor from the left menu in the Tangram OS UI.
2. Click New Catalog and configure it to bind with the newly created DuckLake:


<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>
  <img src={RegisterDuckLakeCatalog} width={"100%"} />
</div>


Once the catalog is created, you can run queries against your DuckLake.

```sql
CREATE TABLE my_ducklake.main.t1(x INT);

FROM my_ducklake.main.t1;

CREATE VIEW my_ducklake.main.v1 AS FROM my_ducklake.main.t1;

```
