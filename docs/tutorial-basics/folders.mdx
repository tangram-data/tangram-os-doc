# Buckets & Folders

In Tangram OS, a **Bucket** is a storage container that uses a cloud blob storage as backend. A **Folder** is logical directory created in a bucket.

Applications can claim buckets and create folders to store application data. When creating a Folder in Tangram OS, a resource can be attached to the Folder as owner resource,
which indicates the folder is owned by the particular resource and stores data related to that resource.

## Folder Explorer

In Tangram UI, we can navigate to `/workspaces/<workspace_name>/folders` to explore folders created in a workspace and explore the contents in the folder.

In the following example, the folder `IcebergDB-test-7d2f9f4d551da309e9513e02f5dedc06ae19b5a6/test_table` is owned by a Iceberg Table:

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>
  <img src={FolderExplorer}  />
</div>
