# DuckDB in Tangram OS

Tangram OS SQL service has DuckDB as a built-in SQL Engine, it is high performance query engine that can be used to query open tables formats like Apache Iceberg or Delta Lake.

:::warning
Different from local DuckDB instance, DuckDB in Tangram SQL server is just a pure compute engine, Tangram SQL doesn't allow users to create DuckDB native tables in Tangram OS as local file system is disabled.
