# Resource

Every entity defined in Tangram OS can be considered a resource—such as a database table, a workflow, an application, or a storage bucket.

## Resource Type
Each resource is associated with a **Resource Type**, which defines its classification and behavior within the system.

A **Resource Type** in Tangram OS is composed of an **application identifier** and a **resource type name**.
The application identifier follows the format:
`<application namespace>/<application name>`

For example: com.clickhouse/clickhouse, where:

- `com.clickhouse` is the **application namespace**
- `clickhouse` is the **application name**

The resource type name defines the specific kind of resource, such as `Table`.

Putting it all together, the **fully qualified Resource Type** for a ClickHouse table in Tangram OS is:
```
com.clickhouse/clickhouse/Table
```


## Resource Type Scope

In Tangram OS, a **Resource Type** can be defined within the scope of a **parent Resource Type**. This hierarchical structure provides contextual containment for resources.

For example:
- A ClickHouse table (`com.clickhouse/clickhouse/Table`) is defined within a ClickHouse schema (`com.clickhouse/clickhouse/Schema`).
- A ClickHouse schema is further defined within a Tangram OS workspace (`ai.tangram-os/core/Workspace`).

## Resource Name
To uniquely identify a resource instance in Tangram OS, a **Resource Name (RN)** URI format is used. This format captures the resource type along with its hierarchical location.

### Example:

```text
rn://com.clickhouse/clickhouse/Table/finance/finance_db/yearly_revenue
```

In this example:

`com.clickhouse/clickhouse/Table` is the resource type.
`finance → finance_db → yearly_revenue` represents the hierarchical path `workspace → clickhouse db → table` to the specific table.


# Resource Id

In Tangram OS, each resource also has a unique id, it's a sha1 hash randomly generated every time a resource is defined or imported into the OS.
