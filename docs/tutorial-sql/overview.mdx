# Overview

**Tangram OS SQL** is a multiple engine service implemented using **PostgreSQL wire protocol**. It enables seamless data exploration, analytics, and transformation across multiple data platforms from a single interface.

Tangram OS SQL Engine supports integration with a variety of query engines, including: **DuckDB**, **ClickHouse**, **Databricks**, and more... 

## Key Features

By abstracting the underlying engines with a open protocol, Tangram OS allows users to:

- **Query seamlessly open table formats like Apache Iceberg, Delta Lake across engines**   
  Native integration with open table formats without complex per engine setup, query Iceberg tables like they are engine native. Example:
  ```SQL
    -- create an Iceberg table
    create table iceberg.test.nyc_taxi(time timestamp, district string, miles double);

    -- insert some data 
    insert into iceberg.test.nyc_taxi(time, district, miles) 
        values('2025-01-01 17:39:09.439', 'Brooklyn', 12.6);

    -- use DuckDB to query a Iceberg table
    use engine duckdb;
    select sum(miles) as total_distance from iceberg.test.nyc_taxi group by district;

    -- use ClickHouse to query the same table
    use engine clickhouse;
    select sum(miles) as total_distance from iceberg.test.nyc_taxi group by district;
  ```
- **Unify data access control with Tangram IAM service** 
  
  As the following example, Tangram SQL will honor the access policy defined via the example role, will allow users with that role to have read-only access to Iceberg tables in workspace `demo` and `test` Iceberg database.

  </div>

- **Maintain engine-specific optimizations**   
  While providing a unified interface, Tangram OS still enables users to utilize engine-specific SQL dialects and capabilities as needed.
