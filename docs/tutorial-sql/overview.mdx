# Overview

**Tangram OS SQL** is a multiple engine service implemented using **PostgreSQL wire protocol**. It enables seamless data exploration, analytics, and transformation across multiple data platforms from a single interface.

Tangram OS SQL Engine supports integration with a variety of query engines, including: **DuckDB**, **ClickHouse**, **Databricks**, and more... 

## Key Features

By abstracting the underlying engines with a open protocol, Tangram OS allows users to:

### Seamlessly Query Open Table Formats Across Engines

Tangram OS SQL natively integrates with open table formats like **Apache Iceberg** and **Delta Lake**, eliminating the need for complex engine-specific setups. You can query these tables as if they were native to the engine. For example:

- **Unify data access control with Tangram IAM service** 
  
  As the following example, Tangram SQL will honor the access policy defined via the example role, will allow users with that role to have read-only access to Iceberg tables in workspace `demo` and `test` Iceberg database.

  </div>

- **Maintain engine-specific optimizations**   
  While providing a unified interface, Tangram OS still enables users to utilize engine-specific SQL dialects and capabilities as needed.
