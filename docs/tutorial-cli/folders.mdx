# Folders
The following commands are used to explore and manage folders in the workspace. 
It's the same as using the UI and navigating to the [Folder Explorer](../tutorial-basics/folders#folder-explorer).

### List available folders in workspace:
```bash
folder ls -w <workspace_name>
```

### List contents folders in a specified folder path:
```bash
folder ls -w <workspace_name> --path <path>
```
