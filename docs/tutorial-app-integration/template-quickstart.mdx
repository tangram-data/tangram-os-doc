## 🚀 Quick Start: Generate an App Template with Tangram CLI

To help you get started, Tangram provides a CLI that can auto-generate a complete manifest and directory structure for your new app integration. This saves you time and ensures the correct structure.

### 1. Install Tangram CLI

Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/tangram-data/tangram-data-os#installation) to install the Tangram CLI.

### 2. Create a New App Template

After selecting a context by `use <context>` , run the following command (replace the placeholders as needed):

```bash
app create <appGroup> <appName> --version <version>
```

- `<appGroup>`: Your organization or app group (e.g. `com.myorg`)
- `<appName>`: Your app's name (e.g. `myapp`)
- `--version`: (Optional) App version, default is `1.0.0`

**Example:**

```bash
app create com.myorg myapp --version 1.0.0
```

#### 👉 What does this do?

- **Generates a directory:** `com.myorg/myapp/manifests/`
- **Creates all required manifest files:** including `app.pkl`, `api/resource_types.pkl`, `api/spec.pkl`, `api/open_api.yml`, `integrations/implemented_integrations.pkl`, and more.
- **Populates resource types:** You’ll be prompted (or can pass flags) to specify the resource types and actions your app supports.

### 3. Customize Your Template

- Edit the generated manifest files to define your app’s resources, API, and integration logic.
- Use the [Onboarding Guide](docs/onboarding_new_app.md) in this repo for detailed instructions.

## 📑 Reference

- See [docs/onboarding_new_app.md](docs/onboarding.md) for a complete step-by-step guide to onboarding a new app with Tangram.
- Review the [tangram-app-manifest](https://github.com/tangram-data/tangram-app-manifest) repo for manifest schema details and additional examples.

---

## 🛠️ Development

- All manifests are written in [Pkl](https://pkl-lang.org/).
- Use `pkl eval` to validate your manifest files.

## Example

Below is an example command to create a new app manifest template for a fictional app:

```bash
tangram app create com.example mydb --version 1.0.0
```

This will produce:

```
com.example/mydb/manifests/
  app.pkl
  api/
    resource_types.pkl
    spec.pkl
    open_api.yml
  integrations/
    implemented_integrations.pkl
  README.md
  ...
```

Continue editing these files as described in the onboarding guide.
