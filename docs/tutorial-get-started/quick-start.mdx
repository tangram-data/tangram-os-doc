# Quick Start Locally

> ⏱️ Time to complete: ~10 minutes

## Prerequisites

- **Java 11+**
- **Minikube** or any other local k8s environment, you can follow this [link](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start) to install Minikube.

If Minikube is not already running on your device, you need to start your Minikube instance before deploying Tangram OS locally.
You will need the minikube configured with at least 6GiB of memory and more than 4 CPUs(ideally more than 6 CPUs and 8GB memory if you want to test Tangram OS Agent chat and Tangram SQL with a local ClickHouse instance). 
```bash
minikube start --memory 6144 --cpus 4 
```


## Deploying Tangram OS Locally in 3 Steps

Before starting, make sure your Minikube instance is up and running on your device.

### 1. Download Tangram CLI Jar

- Download [Tangram CLI JAR](https://github.com/tangram-data/tangram-os-doc/releases/download/tangram-cli-1.0.0-beta.2/tangram-cli_2.13-1.0.0-all.jar) file
- Move it to your preferred directory


### 2. Start Tangram OS CLI Shell
```bash
java -jar ./tangram-cli_2.13-1.0.0-all.jar
```


### 3. Start Local Deployment
:::warning
By executing `local start` command in the CLI shell, you choose to agree with the following terms and conditions: 

Tangram OS may be deployed and used locally only for testing, evaluation purposes. This local deployment is provided as-is, without any warranties, guarantees, or support commitments.
Redistribution to third parties or use for any commercial purposes is prohibited.
:::

```bash
tangram> local start
```
or
```
tangram > local start --with-clickhouse
```

:::info
`--with-clickhouse` is optional for enabling a deployment of a local ClickHouse instance for testing Tangram SQL multi-engine support.
:::

If Tangram OS instance is deployed successfully you should be able to see:
```python
tangram> local>
```

Congratulations! 🎉 You've got Tangram OS up and running on your machine: 

- The Tangram instance **local** is registered and ready to be used with Tangram OS CLI.
- A account is created with name **tangram** and password also set to **tangram**, can be used to login to Tangram UI.
- A workspace named **demo** is created, with **Iceberg App** deployed in the workspace.
- A **catalog** named **iceberg** is created to be used in Tangram SQL for querying Iceberg Tables.

:::info
If any issue encountered during the setup, you can get help in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/R75hw5sxaH) help channel.

## Running Queries Using Tangram OS SQL Shell

1. **Connect to Tangram SQL**
<div style={{ fontSize: '1.1em', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>

```python
#This will start Tangram SQL interactive shell to query data using DuckDB
sql-engine connect duckdb
```
</div>

2. **Set Up Catalog and Database**
<div style={{ fontSize: '1.1em', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>

```sql
-- set current catalog to demo
use catalog iceberg;
-- creating an Iceberg database in catalog demo
create database test;
-- set current database to test 
use database test;
```
</div>

3. **Try to create an Iceberg table and write some data for query**
<div style={{ fontSize: '1.1em', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>

```sql
-- Create and populate a test table
create table test_table (id int, name string);
insert into test_table values (1, 'test');
select * from test_table;
```
</div>

## Explore Tangram UI

Search created Iceberg Table in Tangram OS search bar

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center", marginBottom:"36px", marginTop:"24px"}}>
  <img src={TangramSearch}/>
</div>

You can also query data using [Tangram SQL editor](http://localhost:8081/sql) in Tangram OS UI

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center", marginBottom:"36px", marginTop:"24px"}}>
  <img src={TangramSQLEditor}/>
</div>

Navigating in the **demo** workspace, click on the Applications tab you be able to find Iceberg App.

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center", marginBottom:"36px", marginTop:"24px"}}>
  <img src={DemoIcebergApp}/>
</div>
