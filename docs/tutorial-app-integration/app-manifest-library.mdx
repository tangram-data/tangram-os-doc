# Tangram App Manifest Integration

This repository provides tools, manifest schemas, and onboarding documentation to help you integrate your own application with Tangram using the [tangram-app-manifest](https://github.com/tangram-data/tangram-app-manifest) Pkl library.

## What is Pkl?

[Pkl](https://pkl-lang.org/) is a modern, statically typed configuration language designed for safety, clarity, and reusability. Unlike JSON or YAML, Pkl supports variables, functions, type-checking, imports, and modular configuration. This makes it ideal for complex, large-scale setups where you want to avoid duplication and catch errors early. Pkl’s syntax is easy to read and write, and its files can be embedded or extended by other Pkl files.

Pkl can be interpreted and rendered into a variety of standard formats—including **JSON**, **YAML**, **TOML**, **Java Properties**, and **.env** files—making it easy to integrate with a wide range of tools and platforms. It integrates well with modern development workflows and supports embedding in languages like Java, Kotlin, and Python. 

**In Tangram, Pkl is used to define resource types, APIs, and manifest schemas, making integrations robust and developer-friendly.**
