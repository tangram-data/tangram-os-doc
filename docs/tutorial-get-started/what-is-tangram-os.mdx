# What is Tangram OS

Tangram OS is a control plane that unifies data and application ecosystems by integrating fragmented components into one cohesive platform:

- **Composable**: standardize Apps and data integration across stacks, breaks down silos and enables AI-driven automation.
- **Secure**: governance and access control across data, metadata and application resources with comprehensive audit capabilities.
- **Consistent**: abstracts cloud providers with consistent resource provisioning and application deployment, reduce DevOps burden.

With built-in extensibility, teams can choose the best tools for their needsâ€”without vendor lock-in, along with lineage tracking to capture dependencies between data, tools, and processes. This ensures transparency, compliance, and operational confidence throughout the stack.

## Architecture Overview


export const QuickStartButton = (({}) => {
 function navigateToQuickStart() {
  window.location.href = '/tutorial-get-started/quick-start';
 }
 return <Button type="primary" ghost onClick={navigateToQuickStart} size ="large" style={{width:"300px"}}>Get Started Locally</Button>
});

export const RequestCloudAccess = (({}) => {
 function navigateToQuickStart() {
  window.location.href = 'https://www.tangram-os.ai/join-private-priview';
 }
 return <Button type="primary" onClick={navigateToQuickStart} size ="large" style={{width:"300px"}}>Request Cloud Access</Button>
});

Tangram Core Services, the core orchestration and governance layer, consisting of modular control plane components:

- **Universal Catalog**: A unified repository for all resources and data managed by applications deployed in the OS. It captures app resource automatically in real time and
  requires no explicit configuration for ensuring seamless governance and discovery of application resources - be it data, workflows, or custom resource types, it enables governance and discovery to extend beyond traditional data resources, covering virtually any asset type defined by users.

- **IAM Service**: Identity and Access Management for defining and enforcing fine-grained, role-based access policies across all resources.

- **Compute & Storage Service**: Abstracts and manages underlying compute and storage backends, ensuring consistent provisioning and operational control across cloud providers.

- **Application Service**: Manages lifecycle and runtime operations of deployed applications and services.

- **SQL Service**: A federated SQL engine that enables querying across heterogeneous data engines (e.g., ClickHouse, DuckDB, Databricks) based on PostgreSQL wire protocol.
