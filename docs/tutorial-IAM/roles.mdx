# Roles

Tangram OS implements a **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** model to manage permissions and access to resources.

### Role Definition

A **Role** is an identity that encapsulates a set of permissions. Roles are created within a **workspace** by a **workspace admin**.

- Permissions are assigned to a role to define what actions can be performed on which resource types.
- Once defined, roles can be reused and applied to multiple accounts.

### Role Binding

A **Role Binding** grants the permissions of a role to an **account**.  
An account can be:

- A **user**
- A **user group**
- A **service account**

Role bindings allow centralized management of access policies across different types of identities.


## Role Permission Scope

Tangram OS supports **scoped permissions**, allowing administrators to limit the effect of a role's permissions to a specific context or level of the resource hierarchy.

### Example: Scoped Permission for Iceberg Tables

Consider a role with the ClickHouse `Table:Read` permission:

- **Workspace-Level Scope**:  
  Allows the role to read all ClickHouse tables across the entire workspace.

- **Database-Level Scope**:  
  Restricts read access to ClickHouse tables within a specific ClickHouse database.

- **Table-Level Scope**:  
  Grants permission to read from a single, specific ClickHouse table only.

This scoped approach enables **fine-grained access control**, supporting the principle of least privilege and enhancing security.
