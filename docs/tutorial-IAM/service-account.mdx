# Service Accounts

In Tangram OS, a **Service Account** is a specialized identity used by applications or compute workloadsâ€”such as workflows, data ingestion lambdas, or automated jobs.

## Scope

Service accounts are scoped within a **Workspace**, ensuring that access and permissions are isolated to the appropriate environment.

For example: when an application is deployed within a workspace, Tangram OS automatically provisions a service account associated with that application.

## Access Control

Workspace administrators can assign **roles** to service accounts, enabling fine-grained control over the application's or process's access to resources. This ensures secure, principle-of-least-privilege access to data and services within the workspace.
