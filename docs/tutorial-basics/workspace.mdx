# Workspace

In Tangram OS, a **Workspace** is an isolated environment used to manage resources, such as data, dashboards, infra resources and applications.
Workspaces provide boundaries for organizing and securing resources within a defined scope.

## Workspace Admin
A **Tangram OS account administrator** can create workspaces and assign the **Workspace Admin** role to specific users or user groups.

Workspace Admins are granted privileges to:

- Manage all resources within the workspace  
- Define and modify access rights by assigning roles and permissions to other users, user groups or service accounts.

## Create your first workspace

To create a new workspace in the Tangram UI:

1. Navigate to the `/workspaces` page.
2. Click the **Create** button.
3. Provide a **Workspace Name**:  
   - Must contain only lowercase letters and underscores (`_`).  
4. Select a **User** or **User Group** to assign as the **Workspace Admin**.

The selected Workspace Admin will receive full administrative privileges to manage all resources and access rights within the newly created workspace.
