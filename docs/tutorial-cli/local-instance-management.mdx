# Managing Local Deployment

### Start Tangram OS local deployment

If there's no local instance deployed, this will download and deploy Tangram OS locally, otherwise it will start k8s port forwarding so that local Tangram OS UI and services can be accessed.
```bash
local start
```

### Stop port forwarding:
```bash
local stop
```

### Destroy local deployment
This will destroy Tangram OS local deployment from your device, clean up all resources it deployed.
```bash
local destroy
```
